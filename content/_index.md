Welcome to my RPG notes site!

Here you'll find notes and summaries for various RPG campaigns I've run and played in.

## Current Campaigns

We're currently playing Monster of the Week. The small town of Handfast is being terrorized by a mysterious creature, and the Hunters are called in to investigate.
