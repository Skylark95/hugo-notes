## **Session 1: 11/6/2024**

**June 24**

- **Location:** Crown Dive Bar
  - **Characters Met:**
    - **Dick:** A private investigator who has lived in Handfast for many years. He shares that strange events began happening around 40 years ago, right when his daughter, Violet, disappeared. Violet was only 5 years old, and her disappearance has never been resolved.
    - **Alice:** Reflecting on past events, she mentions that around the time Violet went missing, odd occurrences began in town, such as TVs acting up.
    - **Norville:** Asks Dick and Alice if they’ve noticed food spoiling unexpectedly, hinting that something unnatural might be at play.

- **Sadie’s Visit to the Library**
  - **Eleanor Brown, Librarian:** Sadie encounters Eleanor Brown, a local librarian, who shares interesting information about Handfast:
    - **Town History:** Handfast was founded in 1615 and remained a farming community until tourists began arriving.
    - **Unusual Events:** Eleanor notes that strange things started happening in the 1970s, and the oddities have been recurring recently. People are discussing unusual food spoilage, and the weather has been unseasonably warm.
    - **Mysterious Attack:** Eleanor has a gash on the back of her leg, which she attributes to being attacked by a “thing.” She doesn’t recall the specifics of the attack.

- **Sudden Shift in Weather:**
  - A sudden and intense change in the weather forces everyone to seek shelter, except for Cat and Dick, who stay outside.

- **Mysterious Encounter:**
  - A figure appears on the roof, and a young woman comes into view, saying, “Hello, you are new around here.”

## **Session 2: 11/13/2024**

- **Encounter with the Young Woman**
  - A young woman appears but doesn’t give her name. Alice is shocked, thinking the woman looks like her missing daughter, Violet.
  - Henry fully transforms into his werecorgi form, attacking the young woman after her face briefly changes to resemble his own.
  - After Henry’s attack, the woman runs off. Beck and Henry try to chase her but fail.
  - Norville tries to talk to Alice afterward, but Alice isn’t ready to speak yet.

- **Sadie’s Investigation**
  - Sadie heads outside to search for the young woman and finds barefoot footprints leading up the road and out of town.
  - Sadie suspects this young woman isn’t entirely human, recalling stories of beings who were once human but have since changed.

- **Alice and Her Connections**
  - Alice heads home, and we learn she’s married to John (whom we haven’t met yet).
  - Dick, a private investigator, is friends with Alice. Beck, Norville, and Sadie decide to visit Alice the next day to gather more details.

- **After the Incident**
  - Henry reverts to his human form, and Beck carries him back into the bar.
  - The group disperses for the night:
    - **Beck** returns to her short-term rental in town.
    - **Sadie** heads to her van, parked close to the tavern near Handfast Children’s Park.
    - **Norville** takes Henry with her to her home, a ranch house with a dingy basement a few blocks away on Orchard Street. She uses her skateboard to get home.

      - **Observations on the Way Home:**
        - The movie theater across from the bar is badly damaged by the tornado that swept through town around 10:30 pm.
        - Norville feels uneasy on her way back, noticing strange black clouds near the ground.
        - While a few buildings were completely wrecked, most of the town remains intact.
      - Once home, Norville checks Twitter. Locals are discussing the storm, but there are no mentions of strange occurrences or unusual beings.
      - She arrives home early at 11:30 pm to find her boyfriend already there; the bar usually closes at midnight.

- **Bar Condition**
  - When Norville left the bar, the window was covered with a tarp, providing only minimal security.
