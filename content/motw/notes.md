**June 24**

#### **Location:** Crown Dive Bar

- **Characters Met:**
  - **Dick:** A private investigator who has lived in Handfast for many years. He shares that strange events began happening around 40 years ago, right when his daughter, Violet, disappeared. Violet was only 5 years old, and her disappearance has never been resolved.
  - **Alice:** Reflecting on past events, she mentions that around the time Violet went missing, odd occurrences began in town, such as TVs acting up.
  - **Norville:** Asks Dick and Alice if they’ve noticed food spoiling unexpectedly, hinting that something unnatural might be at play.

#### **Sadie’s Visit to the Library**

  - **Town History:** Handfast was founded in 1615 and remained a farming community until tourists began arriving.
  - **Unusual Events:** Eleanor notes that strange things started happening in the 1970s, and the oddities have been recurring recently. People are discussing unusual food spoilage, and the weather has been unseasonably warm.
  - **Mysterious Attack:** Eleanor has a gash on the back of her leg, which she attributes to being attacked by a “thing.” She doesn’t recall the specifics of the attack.

#### **Sudden Shift in Weather:**

- A sudden and intense change in the weather forces everyone to seek shelter, except for Cat and Dick, who stay outside.

#### **Mysterious Encounter:**

## **Session 2: 11/13/2024**

#### **Encounter with the Young Woman**

- A young woman appears but doesn’t give her name. Alice is shocked, thinking the woman looks like her missing daughter, Violet.

#### **Sadie’s Investigation**

#### **Alice and Her Connections**

  - **Sadie** heads to her van, parked close to the tavern near Handfast Children’s Park.

  - **Norville** takes Henry with her to her home, a ranch house with a dingy basement a few blocks away on Orchard Street. She uses her skateboard to get home.

      - The movie theater across from the bar is badly damaged by the tornado that swept through town around 10:30 pm.
      - Norville feels uneasy on her way back, noticing strange black clouds near the ground.
      - While a few buildings were completely wrecked, most of the town remains intact.
    - Once home, Norville checks Twitter. Locals are discussing the storm, but there are no mentions of strange occurrences or unusual beings.
    - She arrives home early at 11:30 pm to find her boyfriend already there; the bar usually closes at midnight.

    - Fasthands is famous for its croissants and its rude baker, Mary.
  - On the way, the group notices a lot of debris in the river, but otherwise, there’s little sign of storm damage.

- **Alice’s Memories of Violet**:

  - Alice shows the group a box of pictures:
    - A photo of Violet at 1 year old.
    - A 5-year-old photo: Violet loved being outdoors and couldn’t stay in one spot. Everyone in town adored her since there weren’t many young kids around.
    - The group notices that Violet had a distinct freckle and looked older (around 15\) in the face they saw last night.

    - **Rosa (the woman)**:
      - Attacked three days ago just after dusk. She doesn’t remember who or what attacked her.

    - **Ray (the older man)**:
      - Attacked the day before Rosa.
    - Eleanor was attacked two days ago.
- Sadie and Beck spot a shadowy figure. They investigate and find footprints and broken branches in the trees, indicating the figure had been heading toward Sadie’s van.

## **Session 4: 12/04/2024**

**June 25**

#### **Henry’s Morning**

- **Waking Up:** Henry wakes up on Norville's couch (unclear how he got there initially) and sneaks out without alerting her. He heads home uneventfully.

  - At his house, he reads in the paper about everyone’s refrigerators malfunctioning at the same time.


- **Returning to the Tavern:** Henry heads back toward the tavern, where **Eli**, the bartender, is working.

  - Eli mentions **Constance** was attacked while walking her dogs. She doesn't remember the attack clearly (details were unclear during gameplay).

  - **Front Entrance:** He finds the damaged doors stuck and difficult to open.
  - **Back Entrance:** He discovers an unlocked back door and enters.
  - **The Projector Room:** Heading upstairs, he finds a partially open doorway. Inside, **Norville** is bound and shackled on the floor. She has been there for 30 minutes.


- **Confronting the Creature:** Norville’s abductor is muttering, “Should I take the blood now?” and “You are not Violet.”

  - The creature is clearly not human, with sharp hands and long fingernails.
  - Henry is spotted and the creature tries to capture him. Henry attempts to use puppy dog eyes, but the creature is unaffected.
  - Norville struggles to escape while still bound, managing to get past Henry.
  - The creature follows Henry, prompting Henry to go full were-corgi.

  - The creature catches up, but Henry bites it again, visibly weakening the creature.
  - The creature blocks the door, but Henry manages to escape to get help.

- **Deciding Next Steps:** The group initially plans to report the stolen van to the police on **St. Albans St.**, but instead decides to investigate **Pleasant St.**

  - Cat calls the police while walking. Officer **Ed** answers; he’s stressed due to the recent surge in attack reports.

#### **Alice’s Old House**

- **Arriving at the House:** The group visits Alice’s old house, where Violet went missing.

  - There’s no sign the van passed by.
  - Sadie uses a **tile tracker**, but it doesn’t locate the van.


- **Meeting Ray:** Cat knocks, and **Ray** (from the park) answers. He’s in his 70s and has the same kind of cut on his arm as the other victims. Ray invites them inside.

  - Ray calls for **Nancy.**


- **Sadie’s Observations:**

  - Victims of the attacks have kids or grandkids but are attacked late, at dusk.
  - The girl from earlier mentioned she was "looking for a kid" but rejected Henry in were-corgi form, saying, “It isn’t him.”
  - Notably, no kids have been attacked, only adults walking home or outside at night.

**Location: Crown Dive Bar**

#### **At the Bar**

- Patrons: Dick is present; Alice is not (she is at home).

  - He mentions that there’s more weirdness in the town than they realize.
  - Dick appears hurt and avoids discussing Violet or the past, which clearly brings him pain.
  - He reveals that he stayed in town for a reason but insists that revisiting the past won’t help.
  - Dick tells Henry he knows he’s not really 8 years old.
    - Henry briefly turns his face into werecorgi form and warns Dick that no one will believe him about it.
    - This visibly unsettles Dick.
  - Dick warns Norville, “If you know what’s good for you, you’ll stay away from Alice and all this.”
- **Revealing Information:**
  - Norville tells Dick she was abducted by “Football Man,” whose name is **Bonecruncher**.
  - Sadie reveals the group has seen Violet twice.
  - Dick is unsurprised they saved Max from being abducted and hints that he knows Violet was abducted in the past, possibly understanding more than he lets on.
- **Dick agrees to help but imposes two conditions:**
  1. They must stop talking to Alice about it.
  2. They must not harm Violet.
  * When the group attempts to lie about not hurting Violet, Dick sees through it.
  * Angrily, he fires his gun into the ceiling, ending the conversation abruptly.

## **Session 8: 02/12/2025**

**Saturday Night**

#### **At Violet’s House**

* Beck and Sadie approach Violet’s house and see Cat in the front lawn.
* The deputy on the scene is not Officer Ed.
* Cat tries to tell everyone everything is fine, but Beck thinks he’s in trouble, so she checks on him. Sadie leaves to avoid attracting the attention of the police.

* Cat uses the deputy’s phone to call his parents, and his parents come to pick him up.
* Beck heads back to her Airbnb. Sadie is there, and they catch up on what happened.

**Sunday Morning**

#### **Jaida’s House**

* Norville heads to Jaida’s house.
* Jaida takes her toward the woods to “show her something.”
* When Henry goes to get the paper in the morning, he swears he hears Norville (Jaida’s house is nearby). Henry heads that way and approaches Norville and Jaida.
* There is a “circle” in the woods. In the ground is a sigil with small and large footprints.
* Jaida shows them a book of fey creatures. She says the big guy with Violet is not of this world. According to the book, he is a redcap and has to kill to live. You cannot kill a redcap with brute strength. The only way to kill a redcap is to either prevent him from getting his cap wet or take his hat from him.
* Jaida says the big guy is dangerous and is likely here for someone else.
* Rumor has it that Handfast is sustained by other worldly powers. The prosperity of the town is not entirely natural. Jaida thinks taking another kid must be part of the contract or a consequence of not keeping the contract.
* Jaida tells Henry she’s sorry when hearing he is a werecorgi, but it is unclear why.
* Norville cuts her hand to try and open the portal, but it doesn’t work.
* Jaida recommends that Norville get the rest of the crew before trying to go through the portal.
* They try to leave without leaving any sign they were there, but Henry leaves werecorgi hair.

#### **Dick’s House**

* Norville, Henry, and Jaida go to check on Dick.

#### **Crown Dive Bar**

* Cat heads to the bar looking for Sadie, but does not find Sadie or Beck there. He goes back to grab his bike. There is no one there anymore at Violet’s house.
