## **Session 1: 11/6/2024**

**June 24**

- **Location:** Crown Dive Bar
  - **Characters Met:**
    - **Dick:** A private investigator who has lived in Handfast for many years. He shares that strange events began happening around 40 years ago, right when his daughter, Violet, disappeared. Violet was only 5 years old, and her disappearance has never been resolved.
    - **Alice:** Reflecting on past events, she mentions that around the time Violet went missing, odd occurrences began in town, such as TVs acting up.
    - **Norville:** Asks Dick and Alice if they’ve noticed food spoiling unexpectedly, hinting that something unnatural might be at play.

- **Sadie’s Visit to the Library**
  - **Eleanor Brown, Librarian:** Sadie encounters Eleanor Brown, a local librarian, who shares interesting information about Handfast:
    - **Town History:** Handfast was founded in 1615 and remained a farming community until tourists began arriving.
    - **Unusual Events:** Eleanor notes that strange things started happening in the 1970s, and the oddities have been recurring recently. People are discussing unusual food spoilage, and the weather has been unseasonably warm.
    - **Mysterious Attack:** Eleanor has a gash on the back of her leg, which she attributes to being attacked by a “thing.” She doesn’t recall the specifics of the attack.

- **Sudden Shift in Weather:**
  - A sudden and intense change in the weather forces everyone to seek shelter, except for Cat and Dick, who stay outside.

- **Mysterious Encounter:**
  - A figure appears on the roof, and a young woman comes into view, saying, “Hello, you are new around here.”

## **Session 2: 11/13/2024**

- **Encounter with the Young Woman**
  - A young woman appears but doesn’t give her name. Alice is shocked, thinking the woman looks like her missing daughter, Violet.
  - Henry fully transforms into his werecorgi form, attacking the young woman after her face briefly changes to resemble his own.
  - After Henry’s attack, the woman runs off. Beck and Henry try to chase her but fail.
  - Norville tries to talk to Alice afterward, but Alice isn’t ready to speak yet.

- **Sadie’s Investigation**
  - Sadie heads outside to search for the young woman and finds barefoot footprints leading up the road and out of town.
  - Sadie suspects this young woman isn’t entirely human, recalling stories of beings who were once human but have since changed.

- **Alice and Her Connections**
  - Alice heads home, and we learn she’s married to John (whom we haven’t met yet).
  - Dick, a private investigator, is friends with Alice. Beck, Norville, and Sadie decide to visit Alice the next day to gather more details.

- **After the Incident**
  - Henry reverts to his human form, and Beck carries him back into the bar.
  - The group disperses for the night:
    - **Beck** returns to her short-term rental in town.
    - **Sadie** heads to her van, parked close to the tavern near Handfast Children’s Park.
    - **Norville** takes Henry with her to her home, a ranch house with a dingy basement a few blocks away on Orchard Street. She uses her skateboard to get home.

      - **Observations on the Way Home:**
        - The movie theater across from the bar is badly damaged by the tornado that swept through town around 10:30 pm.
        - Norville feels uneasy on her way back, noticing strange black clouds near the ground.
        - While a few buildings were completely wrecked, most of the town remains intact.
      - Once home, Norville checks Twitter. Locals are discussing the storm, but there are no mentions of strange occurrences or unusual beings.
      - She arrives home early at 11:30 pm to find her boyfriend already there; the bar usually closes at midnight.

- **Bar Condition**
  - When Norville left the bar, the window was covered with a tarp, providing only minimal security.

  - Still recovering from a large gash down the back of her leg.
  - Mentions that the storm and recent events feel eerily similar to 40 years ago when Alice’s daughter Violet went missing.

    - Fasthands is famous for its croissants and its rude baker, Mary.
  - On the way, the group notices a lot of debris in the river, but otherwise, there’s little sign of storm damage.

  - Alice says she’ll join them in a moment, mentioning that John went out for a walk.

- **Alice’s Memories of Violet**:
  - Alice shows the group a box of pictures:
    - A photo of Violet at 1 year old.
    - A 5-year-old photo: Violet loved being outdoors and couldn’t stay in one spot. Everyone in town adored her since there weren’t many young kids around.
    - The group notices that Violet had a distinct freckle and looked older (around 15) in the face they saw last night.

  - **Injuries**: The older man and the woman have similar injuries to Eleanor’s leg wound.
    - **Rosa (the woman)**:
      - Attacked three days ago just after dusk. She doesn’t remember who or what attacked her.
      - Lives near Alice’s old house, close to where Violet disappeared.
    - **Ray (the older man)**:
      - Attacked the day before Rosa.
    - Eleanor was attacked two days ago.

**June 25**

- **Waking Up:**  
  Henry wakes up on Norville's couch (unclear how he got there initially) and sneaks out without alerting her. He heads home uneventfully.  
  - At his house, he reads in the paper about everyone’s refrigerators malfunctioning at the same time.

- **Returning to the Tavern:**  
  Henry heads back toward the tavern, where **Eli**, the bartender, is working.  
  - Eli mentions **Constance** was attacked while walking her dogs. She doesn't remember the attack clearly (details were unclear during gameplay).  
  - Henry notices the movie theater door is off its hinges. Eli thinks the damage was caused by the storm.

  - **Front Entrance:** He finds the damaged doors stuck and difficult to open.  
  - **Back Entrance:** He discovers an unlocked back door and enters.  
  - **The Projector Room:** Heading upstairs, he finds a partially open doorway. Inside, **Norville** is bound and shackled on the floor. She has been there for 30 minutes.  

- **Confronting the Creature:**  
  Norville’s abductor is muttering, “Should I take the blood now?” and “You are not Violet.”  
  - The creature is clearly not human, with sharp hands and long fingernails.  
  - Henry is spotted and the creature tries to capture him. Henry attempts to use puppy dog eyes, but the creature is unaffected.  
  - Norville struggles to escape while still bound, managing to get past Henry.  
  - The creature follows Henry, prompting Henry to go full were-corgi.  

- **The Fight:**  
  - Henry bites the creature and then works to free Norville by biting through her ropes.  
  - The creature catches up, but Henry bites it again, visibly weakening the creature.  
  - The creature blocks the door, but Henry manages to escape to get help.

  Norville escapes, picks up Henry, and they head back to the tavern.

#### **At the Park**

  Sadie and Beck investigate a shadowy figure, finding footprints and broken branches in the trees leading toward Sadie’s van.  
  - The van’s engine starts.  
  - Beck runs after the van and grabs the door, but her feet are dragged along the street.  
  - Sadie tries to stop the van by standing in its path, but Cat tackles her out of the way and is hit by the van. The van speeds off, and they lose sight of it.  

- **Deciding Next Steps:**  
  The group initially plans to report the stolen van to the police on **St. Albans St.**, but instead decides to investigate **Pleasant St.**  
  - Cat calls the police while walking. Officer **Ed** answers; he’s stressed due to the recent surge in attack reports.  

#### **Alice’s Old House**
- **Arriving at the House:**  
  The group visits Alice’s old house, where Violet went missing.  
  - There’s no sign the van passed by.  
  - Sadie uses a **tile tracker**, but it doesn’t locate the van.  

- **Meeting Ray:**  
  Cat knocks, and **Ray** (from the park) answers. He’s in his 70s and has the same kind of cut on his arm as the other victims. Ray invites them inside.  
  - Ray calls for **Nancy.**  

- **Sadie’s Observations:**  
  - Victims of the attacks have kids or grandkids but are attacked late, at dusk.  
  - The girl from earlier mentioned she was "looking for a kid" but rejected Henry in were-corgi form, saying, “It isn’t him.”  
  - Notably, no kids have been attacked, only adults walking home or outside at night.  

#### **Back to the Tavern**
The group decides to regroup at the tavern to share their findings and plan their next move. They consider keeping watch near the park tonight to see if the girl returns.
