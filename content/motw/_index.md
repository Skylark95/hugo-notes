## Player Characters

- **Cat Treebranch (Hex):**\
  Watch a 80s 90s slasher film and I am the jerk that dies third. My character looks like Johnny Depp, he’s 19. He’s overly flirtatious, thinks he’s way cooler than he actually is. He works basically as a janitor at the library, and spends his nights moonlighting at the bar.

- [**Rebecca "Beck" Graves (Wronged):**](player-characters/rebbeca)\
Rebecca is a hardened survivor in her early 30s driven by a relentless need for revenge. After losing her younger brother to a vengeful spirit, she has devoted her life to hunting down the supernatural. Her harrowed eyes and worn clothes reflect the toll her journey has taken on her, but her determination is unshakable. In combat, she fights with reckless abandon, often putting herself in danger to protect others, ensuring no one else suffers the way she has. Armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a big knife, she’s always ready to face her prey head-on.
