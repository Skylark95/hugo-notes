## Character Details

**Name:**\
  *Rebecca "Beck" Graves*

**Pronouns:**\
  *She/Her*

**Age:**\
Early 30s

**Look:**\
  *Harrowed eyes, ragged clothes*

Rebecca looks like she hasn't slept in days, with dark circles under her haunted eyes. She wears old, worn-out clothes that have seen more fights than fashion.

**Ratings:**\
  *Charm 0, Cool 0, Sharp +1, Tough +2, Weird 0*

Rebecca is tough, quick to adapt, but not particularly charismatic. She's more about action than talk, and her sharpness is often shown in how she assesses threats rather than reading people.

**Who You Lost:**\
  *Your sibling(s)*

Rebecca's younger brother, Chris, was everything to her. They grew up together, with her acting as his protector. When the monster came, she swore to take it down. But she couldn't. And that failure haunts her every waking moment.

**What Did It:**\
  *A vengeful spirit of a mass murderer who died violently*

The spirit targeted families, reliving its own murderous spree in death. Rebecca and Chris had no idea they were next, until it was too late. The spirit trapped them in their home, and by the time Rebecca fought her way out, Chris was gone.

**Why Couldn’t You Save Them?**\
  *You were weak and slow*

Rebecca wasn't strong enough to defeat the spirit and too slow to get Chris out in time. Every day since then has been a struggle to prove to herself she's not that weak person anymore.


## Moves

1. **I Know My Prey:**  
   Rebecca gets +1 ongoing when knowingly investigating, pursuing, or fighting the breed of monster that caused her loss (the vengeful spirit).

2. **Berserk:**  
   Rebecca can keep fighting no matter how much harm she takes. During a fight, the Keeper cannot use harm moves on her, and she cannot die until the fight ends. After the fight, all harm takes effect as normal. This fits her relentless pursuit of revenge and unwillingness to give up, no matter the odds.

3. **NEVER AGAIN:**  
   In combat, Rebecca can choose to protect someone without rolling, as if she had rolled a 10+, but she cannot choose to “suffer little harm.” This emphasizes her protective nature, especially after losing her brother. She'll never let anyone else suffer the same fate.


## Gear

1. **Signature Weapon:**  
   *Sawn-off shotgun* (3-harm hand/close messy loud reload)  
   This weapon packs a powerful punch in close quarters and suits Rebecca's aggressive style of combat.

2. **Practical Weapons:**  
   - *9mm* (2-harm close loud)  
   A reliable, semi-automatic pistol for situations that require quick reactions and precision.
   - *Big knife* (1-harm hand)  
   A practical, close-combat weapon for when things get up close and personal. Rebecca always has it on her.
