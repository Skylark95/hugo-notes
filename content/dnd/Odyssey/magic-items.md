Antikythera Device
------------------
Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

The Antikythera is a complex construct that acts as a magical compass. It also has the power to mend damage to a ship: once per day it can magically repair 50 hit points of damage to a ship it is aboard.


It uses the constellations to guide its user to islands in the Cerulean Gulf or Forgotten Sea. Every island in these seas are associated with a specific constellation. The Antikythera must be used on dry land as the constant movement of waves makes it impossible to calibrate. When it is calibrated to the proper constellations, it will show a path that can be used to reach the island associated with a particular constellation.

Helm of Brilliance
------------------

Requires Attunement

This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

- You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: daylight (opal), fireball (fire opal), prismatic spray (diamond), or wall of fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

- As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.

- As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.

- As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop
or stow the weapon.

Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.


Ring of Protection
------------------
- Sounds base of neck, voices
- Remember us, remember us, save us, bring us back
- Find the queen of the amazons, find me

You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing this ring.

Shortbow of Cupidity
--------------------
Weapon (shortbow), legendary (requires attunement)

Attacks made with this weapon have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Once per day, on a successful hit, you may force the target to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is charmed by you for one hour.

Gloves Of Swimming And Climbing
-------------------------------
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don't cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.

Gloves Of Missile Snaring
-------------------------
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 +your Dexterity modifier. provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
