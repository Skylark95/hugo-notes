Bracers of Archery
------------------
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing these bracers, you have proficiency with the longbow and shortbow, and you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls on ranged attacks made with such weapons.


Oathbinder
----------
Legendary warhammer (requires attunment by a creature of non-evil alignment)

+2 bonus to attack and damage rolls

When you hit a fiend or undead, the creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has fewer than 25hp, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wis save or be destroyed. On a success, they are frightened until the end of your next turn.

While holding this weapon you shed bright light for 20ft. and dim light an additional 20 ft.

Once per day you can use an action to cast Beacon of Hope.

Sentience: Oathbinder is a lawful good weapon with a Int of 12, Wis of 14, and Cha of 14. It has hearing and normal vision out to 60 ft. It can speak, read and understand Common and Celestial. It has a strong, feminine voice. It knows every anguage you know while attuned to it.

Personality. Imbued with the lifeforce of an ancient celestial, Oathbinder is the sworn enemy of fiends and other evil extraplanar creatures. It speaks only when it has something important to say, and can often be openly curt and matter-of-fact when doing so. Oathbinder is courageous in the face of all that is evil. If its wielder actively chooses to flee from facing an extraplanar evil, such as a demon or powerful undead, and can't provide good justification for doing so, the weapon openly mocks them for their cowardice until the wielder can redeem themselves by defeating a worthy evil opponent. A protector of life and light, Oathbinder has no patience for those who perform acts spurned by dishonesty and corruption. It strongly protests against any wielder who continuously participates in such actions, and can be very disagreeable when its wielder consistently tolerates others who do the same.
