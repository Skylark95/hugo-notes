## Character Summary
**Nicholas Crowe**

**Deity:** Kelemvor (god of death and the dead)

**Backstory:** Nicholas Crowe was trained as an exorcist in a temple dedicated to Kelemvor. He was renowned for his ability to guide lost spirits to the afterlife and protect the living from malevolent entities. However, he was framed for a crime he didn't commit and exiled from his homeland.

**Crime:** Desecration of graves at the temple. He believes it was done by a local cult worried about being caught after Nicholas saved a woman in town under their influence. The cult planted evidence of Nicholas' within the graveyard and sewed distrust among the townsfolk.

**Life on the Run:**  Fearing for his life and seeking to clear his name, Nicholas fled his homeland. He now wanders Faer√ªn, taking odd jobs to survive. The cult, however, remains on his trail, forcing him to constantly move from town to town.
