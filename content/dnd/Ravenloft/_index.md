## The story so far

The players' characters are introduced, but their descriptions are not yet fleshed out. The party receives a job to escort a caravan to Bavaria for a man named Colyan Indirovich, whose lover Ireena is suffering from a mysterious affliction.

The party encounters a gate with unfamiliar heads on it that swings open as they approach. They find a corpse with a letter mentioning a vampire bite. Afterward, they are surrounded by wolves led by a large black wolf with regenerative abilities. The party fights the wolves and then approaches a town where they hear mournful sobbing and see broken windows and boarded-up shops. They encounter children who tell them of a monster in their house, and the party enters the house to investigate.
