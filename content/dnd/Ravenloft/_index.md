## The story so far

The players' characters are introduced. The party receives a job to escort a caravan to Bavaria for a man named Colyan Indirovich, whose lover Ireena is suffering from a mysterious affliction.

The party encounters a gate with unfamiliar heads on it that swings open as they approach. They find a corpse with a letter mentioning a vampire bite. Afterward, they are surrounded by wolves led by a large black wolf with regenerative abilities. The party fights the wolves and then approaches a town where they hear mournful sobbing and see broken windows and boarded-up shops. They encounter children who tell them of a monster in their house, and the party enters the house to investigate.

The party enters the house and explores each floor, finding signs that something is amiss and encountering a specter of a servant and the ghosts of the children who once lived there. They learn of a monster in the basement and head down to investigate, where they encounter a room full of moldy skeletons and a statue of a man and a black wolf. They pick up a smoky grey orb from the statue, which causes multiple creatures to appear. The session ends with the party defeating a mimic disguised as a door.
