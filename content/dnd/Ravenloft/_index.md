## The story so far

The players' characters are hired by a man named Colyan Indirovich to escort a caravan to Barovia. Their mission is to protect Ireena, Colyan's lover, who suffers from a mysterious affliction. They are warned of werewolves in the area.

The party travels west and encounters a strange gate with heads on it and a corpse with a letter about a vampire attack. They are then surrounded by wolves, including a large, regenerating black wolf. After the encounter, they arrive at a town with boarded-up shops and hear mournful sobbing. Children tell them of a monster in their house, and the party enters to investigate.

Inside the house, the party explores multiple floors, encountering eerie decorations, a specter, and the ghosts of the children. They discover a secret passage, a skeleton with a mysterious letter and spell scrolls, and a disturbing nursery. They learn the house belonged to the Durst family and something terrible happened there. The party continues to the fourth floor, where they encounter the ghosts of the Durst children and learn about a monster in the basement. They take a long rest and level up before heading to the basement.

In the basement, they find a room of shackled skeletons, a statue with a smoky grey orb, and a mimic disguised as a door. After defeating the mimic, they explore further into the basement. They discover empty crypts, then a hidden chamber with undead. They hear chanting and find a prison area. They enter a water-filled room with an altar, where they witness shadowy figures and an abomination. Elara dies but is resurrected. They escape the now-transformed Death House, which seems to be alive and malevolent. A drunk welcomes them to Barovia.

The party then continues to the town of Barovia, where they meet Ismark the Lesser, who reveals that Ireena is his sister and that Strahd, a vampire lord, has bitten her. Ismark asks for their help to escort Ireena to the walled town of Vallaki to protect her from Strahd. They go to Ismark's mansion and then the church, where they encounter Donavich, the priest, and his vampire son, Doru, whom the party is forced to kill. They then depart Barovia and encounter a group of Vistani. Madam Eva reads their fortunes, giving them cryptic clues about their quest.
