    * We see people in stocks with donkey heads who were arrested for "lack of joy."
    * He is "stuck" here because the carnival is part of the festivals.

It seems he has some sort of deformation; his arm on the right side gets bigger and bulkier than it should be, with a claw coming out. Skull shapes come out of his pipe. He has a dark red claw and arm. The guard's name is Ivax Strazy, the Burgomaster's personal bodyguard and head of the guards here. He grew up here as an orphan. He is a bit of a sociopath. When young, he was attacked by a dire wolf. He was made fun of by others, and it is rumored he killed them.

  * Henrik, the coffin maker, paid him 2 gold to take the bones. He has a house in town over by the stockyard.
