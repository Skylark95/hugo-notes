## Session 11: 04/05/2025

**Location:** Winery

* **Reward:** Get a shipment of wine to the Vistani.
* **Quest:** Three ancient seeds were planted at the winery; two were lost. The tree folk took the last one, and the crops at the winery won’t last past a season without it.
  * Yester Hill is where the tree folk came from (to the south).
* The party leaves for Yester Hill and comes upon a bundle of clothing stuffed in a hollow log (drab common clothes).
  * Boots and paw footprints are seen.
  * The party burns the clothes.
* The party continues south and arrives at Yester Hill.

**Location:** Yester Hill

* The party hears the sound of distant hooves coming from behind and hides in nearby trees.
* A flaming-mane horse runs through the sky and circles the hill. Someone is riding the horse.
* Forest druids come from the rocks (approximately a dozen are seen).
* The party heads up the hill.
* The party sees a giant statue of a man with fangs.
* On the other side of the ring, there are small, sickly trees with blood and sap running down one tree. Humanoid needle creatures are roaming around it. Ten druids are in the ring chanting and doing some sort of ritual.
* The party finds Strahd as the rider on the horse in the grove right to the side of the top of the hill in the grove.
* A large 30-foot treeant appears when a lightning bolt strikes the earth.
* Strahd implies that the treeant is heading towards the winery.
* Nicholas asks about Ireena but fails a Wisdom saving throw and is convinced Strahd is doing good for the land of Barovia.

**Location:** Winery

* The party chases the treeant heading towards the winery and **roll initiative**.
* @11:50 Elara gets pumped.
* **Loot:** There is a grapefruit-sized green gem in the treeant when it is killed. It is probably the seed the party was sent to retrieve.

**Location:** Old Water Tower

* The party starts escorting the wine towards the Vistani camp.
* The party heads towards a lake halfway through the trip and sees a skeletal horse and rider with a lamp looking through the fog. It is heading southeast to northwest. Carriage drivers think it's lost looking for a way through the mist.
* The party approaches an old water tower upon the lake. Near the tower is a purple carriage spattered with mud. The party hears a wolf howl in the distance. Yorick opens the cart, and it explodes. The party hears the wolf howls again, suggesting they are likely to descend upon the group again.
